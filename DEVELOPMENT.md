# Development

## Updating sleep data

When you have new myAir data to add to the dashboard:

1. Log in to [myAir](https://myair.resmed.com/history)
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Navigate to the sleep history page
4. Find the GraphQL response containing `sleepRecords` (filter by `graphql`)
5. Right-click → **Copy Response**
6. In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/update-data.sh
   ```

   That's it — it reads your clipboard and processes the data.

   If you don't have a clipboard utility (`pbpaste`, `xclip`, or `wl-paste`), save manually:

   ```bash
   cat > /tmp/myair.json
   # (paste the JSON here, then press Ctrl+D to finish)
   node scripts/process-data.mjs /tmp/myair.json
   ```

   You'll see output like:

   ```bash
   Wrote 2 file(s) (41 total records):
     2026-05.json  (20 records)
     2026-06.json  (21 records)
   ```

7. The script extracts the records, splits them by month, strips unused fields, and writes to `data/monthlySleepRecords/YYYY-MM.json` (overwriting existing files for those months)
8. Verify the build, then create a branch, commit, push, and open a PR.
